                Hey! I'm Brandon — a curious developer who enjoys building
                things on the web.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I started learning full stack development on my own, and ever
                since, I've been diving into both the frontend and backend
                worlds. Whether it’s crafting interfaces with React or Vue, or
                wiring up logic with Node.js and PostgreSQL, I like turning
                ideas into working apps.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                When I’m not coding, I’m probably exploring new tech, tweaking a
                side project, or learning something random just for fun. Always
                experimenting, always learning.
            </p>
        </div>
